## General info

This repo was created from scratch with GIT & GITBASH. Although its content may not make much sense
to those who visit it, it is here that I have collected reminders for when I need to use GIT via command lines.

## Thanks and how to contribute

Hello there!

This repo will be always under construction!

It serves as a personal lab for practicing the power of JAVA. Definitely a quick access place for my references.

It also consists basically of isolated classes and focuses fundamentally on algorithms that implement the several data structure operations. 

Here there are my codes and also other people's codes that temporarily serve as guidelines until I can implement and improve my programming.

You are welcome to collaborate if you wish.

Feel free to grab some code that might interest you.

Thanks for stopping by!
