## General info

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time (performance – time complexity) or space requirements (memory – spacial complexity) grow as the input size grows.

Big O notation is a way to measure how well a computer algorithm scales as the amount of data involved increases.

	Ex: Array[10 elements] vs Array[10 thousand elements]

It is not always a measure of speed but instead a measure of how well a computer algorithm scales.

45n^3 + 20n^2 + 19 = 84 (n = 1)
	45n^3 + 20n^2 + 19 = 459 (n = 2)
		45n^3 + 20n^2 + 19 = 47.019 (n = 10) n is still a small number
			45n^3 = 45.000
			O(n^3)

Why is it important?

It is important to define with Big O notation the part of the algorithm that has the greatest affect ultimately on the final answer.

## Thanks and how to contribute

Hello there!

This repo will be always under construction!

It serves as a personal lab for practicing the power of JAVA. Definitely a quick access place for my references.

It also consists basically of isolated classes and focuses fundamentally on algorithms that implement the several data structure operations. 

Here there are my codes and also other people's codes that temporarily serve as guidelines until I can implement and improve my programming.

You are welcome to collaborate if you wish.

Feel free to grab some code that might interest you.

Thanks for stopping by!
